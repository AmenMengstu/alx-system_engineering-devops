# What happens when you type www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?
In this project I will be writing a blog post where  I will trace a URL request from the browser all the way to the server hosting it and its response back to the browser to be rendered.
The post will cover the relationship between:
- Websites
- Servers
- IP addresses and   a walk through each of the steps that the browser goes through when you type:
- www.google.com or any URL into your browser and press enter. 
## In summary, here are the steps:
- You type www.google.com in your browser and press Enter
- Browser looks up IP address for the domain (www.google.com)
- Browser initiates TCP connection with the server
- Browser sends the HTTP request to the server
- Server processes request and sends back a response
- Browser renders the content
