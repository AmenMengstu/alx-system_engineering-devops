# 0x0B. SSH
This directory covers SSH operations and configurations.

## Files
### [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key)
A Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:
	Only use ssh single-character flags
        You cannot use -l
	You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase

### [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair)
Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.


### [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config)
SSH client configuration file for connecting to a server without typing a password.

### [100-puppet_ssh_config.pp](./100-puppet_ssh_config.pp)
Let's practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, weâ€™d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.

Requirements:

    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton
    Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
